final project

you will need to make a discord bot and get its token on the official discord development page. You also need to create a file named "birthdayFile.txt" 

Optional: enable dotenv and put the token inside that .env file

dependencies: too many 

How to use:

It is complicated to set up, i can provide a video of me explaining all the different functions if you want.

Commands:

ping: returns pong! in the chat. Used to test if the bot is online
help: returns a list of everything the bot does as well as the time it announces birthdays.
date: returns the date in UTC
time: returns the time in UTC
happy: sends Happy Birthday! in the chat
praise: sends the number of times the bot has been congratulated in the chat
good: thanks the user
setbday MMDD: set the bday for the user in the format MMDD
join: joins the same voice channel as the user
play (url): plays the song to a url. Works with youtube and certain other websites.
loop: loop current queue
queue: shows the current queue of songs to be played
stop: stops the song and clears the queue
pause: pause the music
resume: resumes the music
volume (0-100): sets volume between 0 and 100


I have disabled skipping songs as it was causing some problems.
